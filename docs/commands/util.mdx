## Usage Key

For commands that accept input, you'll see keys with the following:

- `<required>` - parameters between `<>` must be included with the command
- `[optional]` - parameters between `[]` are optional parameters and may be excluded
- a | or | b - | means that you can use the parameters on either side of the symbol
- repeat... - means that you can provide multiple parameters as input

These may be nested. Example: `[parameter1 <parameter2\>]` means that the input is optional, but if you provide parameter1 then parameter2 is required. `[parameter...]` means that input is optional, and that the input can be any number of parameters.
